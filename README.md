# LoRa-communication-with-ESP32-RFM95-real-time-demonstration.
we will develop 2 devices for a real-time demonstration of LoRa Communication with RFM95 LoRa module and ESP32 Development kit. These simple LoRa devices are based on Point to point Lora communication topology. In point-to-point communication, two LoRa enabled devices will talk with each other using RF signals.   As an example, we'll build a simple LoRa Sender and a LoRa Receiver.  The LoRa Sender will be sending a "hello electronics innovation follower " message followed by a counter for testing purposes. The receiver will receive it and show it on the Serial monitor. Later the same message can easily replace with valuable sensor data.
